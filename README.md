## Description

This project explores the implementation and application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for object detection. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* Some Python libraries: TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/VaradaNambiar/ML-CNN.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/VaradaNambiar/ML-CNN.git)
    cd ML-CNN
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Using jupyter notebook:   
0. install a new kernel with the venv created 
   ```bash
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<venv_name>
   ```  
1. open a terminal in the folder where you cloned the repo.
2. activate the virtual environment.
3. type jupyter notebook and press enter.
4. open the desired notebook and run the cells.
